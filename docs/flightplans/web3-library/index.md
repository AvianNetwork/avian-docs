# Info

Avian Flight Plans contains the **Web3 Library** for full access to the EVM chains, such as Polygon, in order to interact with smart contracts.

The library is contained in the `web3` object. 
And EVM chains, like "polygon" would look like this: `web3.polygon`

## Polygon (MATIC)

## ABI (application binary interface)
