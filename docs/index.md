## Welcome to Avian Network!
### What is Avian?

Avian Network is a proof-of-work secured blockchain designed
for efficient and interoperable asset management. The network prioritizes
usability, automation, and low fees to make asset minting and management
simple, affordable, and secure. The network's economy runs on AVN, our
native coin that can be mined on a dual algorithm setup using either GPUs
or CPUs.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Avian Core software, see [https://avn.network](https://avn.network)
